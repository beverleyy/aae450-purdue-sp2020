# AAE 450 - Spring 2020
Codes for Purdue University School of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics AAE450 Senior Spacecraft Design course, Spring 2020

## Project Escalator
Project Escalator is a project from the AAE450 Senior Spacecraft Design course offered at Purdue University's School of Aeronautics and Astronautics for the Spring 2020 semester.

The objectives of this project are to investigate the use of tether slings, electrodynamic tethers and mass drivers as propellantless propulsion technologies, as well as to investigate the new cycler trajectory (Hybrid S1L1) as a human transportation system to and from Mars. The project also aims to consider locations for (nearly) propellantless technologies including LEO, the Moon, Phobos, Mars surface (e.g. Olympus Mons), and others.
